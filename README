=================Client=================
Build:
	make client
That should build a working client no problem

Run:
	Just ./client will suffice. You'll need to enter a server ip and the client's ip
	(although just a unique identifier would prolly be good enough) after that, the
	client will benchmark and connect, and then simply wait for a job to come through.
=======================================

=============Load Balancer=============
Build:
	make server
	That should build the server
Run:
	Use ./load_balancer. When prompted, input the hashed password. Once the server
	says it is starting, you can begin connecting the clients. After each client
	connects, the load balancer will ask if there are more clients to connect. Once
	all clients are connected, answer "N" and the password cracking will start.
