Build:
	make client
That should build a working client no problem

Run:
	Just ./client will suffice. You'll need to enter a server ip and the client's ip
	(although just a unique identifier would prolly be good enough) after that, the
	client will benchmark and connect, and then simply wait for a job to come through.
